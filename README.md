Client Server Development 

1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

To write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, I focus on using clear function and variable names, consistent formatting, and modular design. In Project One, I created the CRUD Python module to handle database operations. By separating database logic into reusable functions, I made it easy to connect those functions to the dashboard widgets in Project Two. The advantage of this approach was that I could quickly adapt the same CRUD module for multiple use cases without rewriting code. In the future, this module could be used in other dashboards, mobile apps, or extended with new database queries as client needs change.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first analyzing the clientâ€™s requirements and then breaking them into smaller, manageable tasks. For Grazioso Salvare, the primary requirement was a database and dashboard capable of filtering and displaying animal outcomes. I began by structuring the database and ensuring my CRUD operations worked properly, then connected them to the dashboard. This project differed from earlier assignments in that it required me to consider usability and how the client would interact with the system, rather than just focusing on the technical code. In future projects, I would continue to use modular design and iterative testing to ensure databases and dashboards meet both functional and user experience requirements.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve problems by designing and building systems that make data valuable and accessible. Their work matters because it helps organizations make informed decisions and improve efficiency. In this project, my dashboard allowed Grazioso Salvare to identify animals best suited for search and rescue training. By turning raw animal intake and outcome data into a visual and interactive tool, I helped the organization save time and resources while supporting its mission. More broadly, computer scientists enable innovation and create tools that improve everyday work for companies and society.
